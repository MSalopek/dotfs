### Setup and pull
git clone https://github.com/MSalopek/dotfs  

## Additional steps
- Install zsh and set it as global shell.

- Install .zsh and plugins (zsh-auto-suggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting) - put them in $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins. These plugins are already referenced in .zshrc.

## TODO
Create a build script to setup automatically after git clone.
